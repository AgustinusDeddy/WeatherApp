# My Weather App

This is me learning React JS by creating a weather app.
This project is based on the same Weather App created by Tyler McGinnis on his react course.
https://github.com/tylermcginnis/react-fundamentals-curriculum

This project is implemented with several concepts such as React Router, async await with axios, semantic UI and es lint.
This project is not a responsive page yet :)

You can check out the demo : https://myweatherapp-eeb3b.firebaseapp.com/

## Installation

```sh
npm install
```

and open http://localhost:8080/ on your browser.
